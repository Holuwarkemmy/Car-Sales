# ðŸš— Car Sales Analysis Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
This project delivers an in-depth analysis of car sales data using a custom-built dashboard. It examines key variables that influence vehicle pricing, demand, and overall marketability. The goal is to equip dealerships, analysts, and stakeholders with practical insights to improve pricing strategies, inventory optimization, and feature-based upselling.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim  
To uncover actionable business intelligence from car sales data and present it through an interactive dashboard that supports decision-making in dealership operations.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
1. Analyze the pricing patterns across fuel types, transmission types, and vehicle conditions.  
2. Understand how cosmetic and technical attributes (e.g. colour, features, mileage) influence resale value.  
3. Provide strategic recommendations to maximize profitability and streamline vehicle offerings.

## ðŸ“Š Detailed Insights  

### 1. Fuel Type Significantly Affects Price  
- **Petrol vehicles** command an **average price of $201K**, significantly higher than other fuel types. This spike is largely due to premium or luxury vehicles in the dataset.  
- **Electric, Diesel, and Hybrid cars** are positioned in the **mid-tier price range** (~$45Kâ€“$47K).  
- **Gasoline-powered cars**, averaging **$23K**, represent the **lowest-value segment**.  

âž¡ï¸ *Fuel type is a strong price differentiator. Dealerships must distinguish between petrol-luxury and petrol-standard to avoid misleading averages.*

---

### 2. Colour Impacts Perceived and Market Value  
- **Silver, White, Black, Blue, and Green** cars average **$57Kâ€“$60K**.  
- **Gray, Orange, Brown, and Yellow** cars sell for about **$23K**.

âž¡ï¸ *Buyers prefer neutral colours, associating them with quality and resale value.*

---

### 3. Transmission Type Affects Price Marginally  
- **Automatic cars** (51%) average **$47K**.  
- **Manual cars** (49%) average **$45K**.  

âž¡ï¸ *Automatics remain slightly more valuable and preferable to modern consumers.*

---

### 4. Vehicle Condition Holds Strong Influence  
- **â€œLike Newâ€**: $47K  
- **New**: $46K  
- **Used**: $46K  

âž¡ï¸ *Buyers pay near-new prices for pristine used vehicles, offering strong margins.*

---

### 5. Accident History Severely Impacts Resale Value  
- **No accidents**: $86K average price, 61K mileage  
- **With accidents**: $37K average price, 74K mileage  

âž¡ï¸ *Transparency and accident-free records increase buyer confidence and pricing.*

---

### 6. Feature Count Distribution Is Skewed  
- **8007 vehicles** have **only 1 feature**  
- Far fewer cars have multiple features (only ~5000 for each 2â€“4 feature category)  

âž¡ï¸ *Low feature count suggests untapped upselling potential through feature bundles.*

## âœ… Strategic Recommendations  

1. **Segment Petrol Cars Further**  
   - Prevent pricing distortion by categorizing â€œLuxury Petrolâ€ separately.  

2. **Prioritize Popular Colour Inventory**  
   - Source and promote high-value neutral colours more aggressively.

3. **Emphasize Automatics and Feature-Rich Models**  
   - Focus inventory and ads around automatic, well-equipped cars.  

4. **Acquire and Certify Accident-Free Vehicles**  
   - Use clean history as a key marketing and pricing advantage.  

5. **Leverage High-Quality Used Inventory**  
   - Promote â€œLike Newâ€ used cars as cost-effective premium options.  

6. **Introduce a Feature-Package Strategy**  
   - Upsell 1-feature cars with bundled upgrades.  

7. **Use Dynamic Pricing Models**  
   - Reflect value more accurately using data-driven price adjustments.
